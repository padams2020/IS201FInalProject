        <p>I believe Aron Baynes is one of the most underrated NBA players of 
            the last decade. While his stats may not leap off the page, any 
            dedicated fan of the teams he played for knows just how critical 
            he was to their success. This webpage is dedicated to showing the 
            common NBA fan that Aron Baynes was far more than just a role 
            player—he was a key piece to the winning formula of every team 
            he suited up for.</p>

        <h3>Career Resumé</h3>
        <p>Aron Baynes is a resilient and hard-working professional basketball 
        player known for his tenacity, defensive prowess, and team-first 
        mentality. Born in New Zealand and raised in Australia, 
        Baynes began his career playing college basketball at Washington 
        State University before going undrafted in the 2009 NBA Draft. 
        He made his mark internationally, playing in Europe before earning 
        a spot in the NBA. Baynes contributed to championship-caliber teams, 
        including playing a key role off the bench for the San Antonio Spurs 
        during their 2014 NBA Championship run. Over his career,

        stretch the floor with improved three-point shooting. Despite setbacks, 
        including a serious spinal injury in 2021, Baynes’ dedication to recovery 
        and basketball showcases his unyielding determination and passion for the
